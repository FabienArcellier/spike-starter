# Spike starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/spike-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/spike-starter)

this tool allow to create a project prefix with the date and the time to
experiment.

```bash
# Simple usage
python -m spike-starter myproject
#Â This command will generate 20180410_0722__myproject
```

It allow to use an existing directory as a reference

```bash
# Generate a directory based on a template
python -m spike-starter --template ~/template/java myproject
python -m spike-starter -t ~/template/java myproject
```

## Usage with alias

An alias can be use to generate a spike based on a specific stack.

```bash
alias spike-starter-python='spike-starter -t ~/projects/0004-spikes_template/python_spike'
alias spike-starter-python3='spike-starter -t ~/projects/0004-spikes_template/python3_spike'
```
