# Spike-starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/spike-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/spike-starter)

spike-starter creates project from blueprint template
and helps me on my experimentation workflow.

```bash
# Simple usage
spike-starter myproject
#Â This command will generate 20180410_0722__myproject
```

It will create a `Spike directory` :

* the name of the `Spike directory` is automatically prefix with date and time
to allow quick classification of experiments.

* the `Spike directory` is initialized as git repository

Spikes are invention from [Kent Beck](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) in Extreme Programming (XP).
It's a special type of story that is used to gain the knowledge
necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach.

## Features

* local blueprint
* remote git blueprint

### local blueprint

It allow to use an existing directory as a reference.

```bash
# Generate a directory based on a template
spike-starter --template ~/template/java myproject
spike-starter -t ~/template/java myproject
```

### remote git blueprint

It can use remote git repository as template. The blueprint is cloned in local
and a new repository is iniated inside.

```bash
# Generate a directory based on a template
spike-starter --template https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-webapp-flask.git myproject
```

## Blueprints

* [FabienArcellier/blueprint-webapp-bootstrap](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-webapp-bootstrap) : `spike-starter --template https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-webapp-bootstrap.git myproject`

## Advanced usage

### Use aliases to have shortcuts to your favorite blueprints

An [alias](https://ss64.com/bash/alias.html) may be use to generate
a spike based on a specific blueprint already on your computer.

```bash
alias spike-starter-python='spike-starter -t ~/projects/0004-spikes_template/python_spike'
alias spike-starter-python3='spike-starter -t ~/projects/0004-spikes_template/python3_spike'
```

# Installation

1. install through pip

```bash
pip install spike-starter
```

After the installation, the command `spike_starter` can be used
from anywhere on your system.

2. install from the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/spike-starter.git
cd spike-starter
pip install .
```

## Contribute

### Continuous integration process

A pull request must pass the continuous integration process
to be merged on ``master``.

```bash
make ci
```

### Continuous deployment process

The automation task ``make deploy_current_version`` will trigger a deployment
based on tag generation.

Travis.ci will deploy the current tagged version on PyPi.

### List automation tasks

```
$make

cd                             run continuous deployment process on spike-starter
ci                             run continuous integration process on spike-starter
deploy_current_version         deploy the current spike-starter version through travis.ci
dist                           build distribution archives
help                           provides cli help for this make file (default)
install                        install python dependencies
lint                           run static analysis on spike-starter
tests_integrations             run only integrations testing on spike-starter
tests                          run automatic testing on spike-starter
venv                           build virtualenv in ./venv directory and install python dependencies
```

# Alternative

This tool is a pet project. I encourage you to take a look on other alternative.

* [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) is a more mature alternative to build project from project template. There is
  a [huge ecosystem of templates](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/README.html#a-pantry-full-of-cookiecutters) available on internet
